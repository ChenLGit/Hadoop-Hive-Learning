------ Limit ------
Without Limit clause, the typical query will return a large number of rows. It will put an upper limit of rows returned.
- Syntax:
  SELECT expr, expr, … FROM tablename; 
  LIMIT n

- Example:
  hive> SELECT name, salary, FROM employees
  LIMIT 2;

  John Doe 100000.0
  Mary Smith 80000.0


------ Where ------
While SELECT clauses select columns, WHERE clauses are filters; they select which records to return.
- Syntax:
  SELECT expr, expr, … FROM tablename; 
  WHERE condition

- Example:
  hive> SELECT name, salary, FROM employees
  WHERE salary >= 100000

  John Doe 100000.0
  Boss Man 200000.0
  Fred Finance 150000.0


------ Order By ------
Order by performs a total ordering of the query result set. This means that all the data is passed through a single reducer
- Syntax:
  SELECT expr, expr, … FROM tablename;
  ORDER BY expr
- Example:
  hive> SELECT name, salary, FROM employees
  ORDER BY salary
  
-*-*-*- All SELECT related Syntax -*-*-*- 
Syntax:
SELECT expr, expr, … FROM tablename
WHERE condition
ORDER BY expr
Limit n

- Conditions can be any Boolean expression
  –country=‘USA’ AND (OR) income>30,000
- Can sort in descending order with ORDER BY expr DESC
- Limit can show the output to the first n rows
