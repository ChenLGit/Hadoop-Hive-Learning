------ Read Data to tables with partition ------
Syntax:
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH ‘path/file’
OVERWRITE INTO TABLE daily;
PARTITIONED BY (field1 STRING, field2 STRING,…);

- Partition allows hive to filter at the input path level and never read non‐matching data
- Increase the efficiency when executing the query only a subset of the data needs.
- Second partition will be a subdirectory of the first partition’s directory

------ Dropping/Adding Partitions ------
Hive’s ALTER TABLE statement provides the
ability to drop or add a partition

--- Adding partition ---
ALTER TABLE employees ADD PARTITION (country =‘US’, state=‘test’ ) location ‘…/employees/US/test’

--- Removing partition ---
ALTER TABLE employees DROP PARTITION (country =‘US’, state=‘test’ )
