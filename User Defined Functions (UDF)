-- You can defined your own function by using Java. But it is generally hard to do.
-- You can also use other people's predefined UDF

Available UDF Libraries
• Piggybank by Hadoop Team at Yahoo!
– Written in Java
– http://pig.apache.org/docs/r0.7.0/api/overviewsummary.html
– Use the piggybank.jar file
– Contains function such as IsDouble, Reverse etc.
• Datafu by LinkedIn
– Written in Java
– Contains functions such as PageRank, Set operations etc.

How to use UDF
• Use the REGISTER feature in Pig to register the jar file 
(piggybank.jar or any jar files you create)
REGISTER ‘path/piggybank.jar’
A = LOAD ‘student_data’ AS (name:charray, age:int, gpa: float)
B = FOREACH A GENERATE org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.string.UPPER(name)
Dump B;
• Optionally use the DEFINE feature to provide alias for the function you want to use
DEFINE UPPER org.apache.pig.piggybank.evaluation.string.UPPER
B= FOREACH A GENERATE.UPPER(name)
