------ Sort By ------
HiveQL supports the SORT BY expression
– Sorts the rows before feeding to a reducer
– Sort order is dependent upon the column type (numeric then numeric order, string is lexicographical order)

Syntax:
SELECT expr, expr, … FROM tablename;
WHERE condition
SORT BY expr

SORT BY
– May use multiple reducers for final output
– Sorts data within each reducer
– Only guarantees ordering of rows within each reducer
– Only have partially ordered results

Order BY
– Single reducer to guarantee global order in output
– Large dataset may take a long time to sort
- Use LIMIT to minimize the time

DISTRIBUTE BY
– Distributes the rows among reducers
– Not guarantee clustering or sorting properties
Example
– SELECT species from table pet DISTRIBUTE BY species

CLUSTER BY
– Combination of DISTRIBUTE BY and SORT BY
– Rows with the same key are distributed to the same reducer
– Sorted within each reducer
Example
– SELECT species from table pet CLUSTER BY species
