------ Select ------
Hive supports creating a table based on SELECT statement
-- Syntax:
    CREATE TABLE new_table
    AS
    SELECT field1, field2 FROM old_table
The column names and definition are inherited from the old_table

Practice:
CREATE TABLE max_diff AS SELECT (high-low) FROM stocks

-- select certain data by various clause (WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT)
SELECT * FROM daily WHERE symbol=='CVA'and (close-open)>0 ORDER BY volume DESC LIMIT 100;
