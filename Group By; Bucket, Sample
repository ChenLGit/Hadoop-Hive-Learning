------ Group By ------
GROUP BY is often used with aggregate function to group the result set with one or more columns;
Syntax:
SELECT year(ymd), avg(close) FROM daily
WHERE exchange=="NYSE" AND symbol=="CVA"
GROUP BY year(ymd);

------ Bucket ------
- Bucketing data is similar to partitioning data
- Data is split into buckets based on the hash value of a column of the incoming data
- Intend to produce an even distribution of rows across n buckets
- Useful for jobs which need to ‘sample’ data from the table
– Jobs which just work on a ‘random’ portion of the data
Syntax:
CREATE TABLE tablename (col_spec);
CLUSTERED BY (col) INTO n BUCKETS
Note: since a hash will be taken of the col column value for each row to determine the destination bucket, that column should contain well‐distributed values


------ Sampleing ------
--- Sampling from bucketed table ---
Syntax: 
SELECT * FROM bucketed_table
TABLESAMPLE (bucket 1 OUT OF 4 on col)
- If the table was bucketed into four buckets on col, this would choose just the rows in bucket1; if 16 buckets, this would choose buckets 1,5,9,13

--- Sampling by full scan of the entire table ---
Syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name TABLESAMPLE(0.1
PERCENT) ;
